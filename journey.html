          <p>Phase 1 is where every great institution begins — with a name, a vision, and the courage to share it publicly before it exists. In 2026, we are laying the entire groundwork that will support everything that follows.</p>
          <p>This phase is about establishing who we are, what we believe, and why Silvertown International School needs to exist. It is about finding our first community of believers — parents, supporters, diaspora members, and educators who share this vision — and bringing them together before a single brick is laid.</p>

          <p>We are building the school's digital presence, telling the Silvertown story, and growing an audience that will become our founding parent community. Every social media post, every website visit, and every message received is an act of foundation-building.</p>
